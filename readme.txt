Add an auction marketplace to your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Prospress goes where no plugin has gone before.

After its 30 second install, your WordPress site will have its very own auction marketplace. Registered users will be able to post auctions, place bids, provide feedback and make payments. Everything needed for a fully functioning marketplace.

= Features =

**Auction Posts** - Prospress uses the WordPress publishing system, so publishing an auction is as enjoyable as publishing a blog post.

**Feedback** - Traders in your marketplace can rate each other after a transaction and view each other's feedback to have confidence about potential transactions.

**Invoicing & Payments** - To finalize transactions, Prospress provides an invoicing system that supports payment with PayPal, credit cards & bank transfers.

See all the great features on the Prospress [Marketplace Features](http://prospress.org/features/) page.


= Demo Marketplace =

If you want to kick the tires of Prospress before installing it, check out the [Demo Marketplace](http://demo.prospress.org/auctions/). You can register, post auctions & make bids on some priceless, stolen artworks.

= Props =

As a major WordPress plugin, Prospress has code and contributions by a number of developers. Special thanks must go to:

* [Scribu](http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/scribu/) for the filter and sort widgets and [Query Multiple Taxonomies](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/query-multiple-taxonomies/) plugin;
* [Andy Potatin](http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/andypotanin/) for customizing his excellent [WP-Invoice](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-invoice/) plugin.

= Get Involved =

Prospress is 100% open source, so you can [contribute](http://prospress.org/contribute/) to the project and help influence its development.

= Want to know more? =

Read the plugin's [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/prospress/faq/) or visit the [Prospress Marketplace Plugin](http://prospress.org) website.


== Installation ==

1. Upload everything into the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate Prospress in the "Plugins" admin panel.

Prospress supports the default TwentyTen theme and will attempt to work with other themes. If you find quirks with your theme, make a post in the [Theme Compatibility forum](http://prospress.org/forums/forum/theme-compatibility/). 


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If you have a question not answered here, please ask in the Prospress [support forums](http://prospress.org/forums/).

= How is Prospress different to other shopping cart plugins? =

There are many great shopping cart plugins for WordPress; Prospress isnâ€™t one of them. 

With Prospress, registered users can post their own auctions, place bids on the auctions of others, provide feedback and make payments. It creates a many-to-many exchange that differs to the one-to-many exchange of an online store.

= Why doesn't a user need to be logged in to Buy Now? =

When a user returns from PayPal after having paid the buy now price for an auction, a user account is automatically created using their PayPal email address. This makes it super easy for anyone to buy and auction, while still creating an invoice and other records associated with the successful completion of an auction.

This is for PayPal's Buy Now only, a user must be registered and logged in to place a bid. 

= Do I need a special theme to use Prospress? =

Prospress attempts to work with your existing theme. It's a primary goal of the Prospress project to support existing WordPress themes rather than require a new one.

Prospress is guaranteed to work with TwentyTen and TwentyEleven themes, but due to the variation in themes, it's likely the built-in templates will display with quirks on other themes. If this happens on your site, not to worry, it's really quite easy to make your own templates. 

If you're comfortable with HTML/CSS, check out the `pp-index-auctions.php` and `pp-single-auction.php` in the *Prospress/pp-posts* folder. These provide a guide for making your own templates. Just add two custom template files, named `index-auctions.php` and `single-auction.php`, to your theme's directory and Prospress will use them automatically.

If you need help, ask in the Prospress [Theme Compatibility](http://prospress.org/forums/forum/theme-compatibility/) forum.

= Where do I view Auctions? =

Prospress creates it's own special index page, called *auctions*. Once you publish your first auction, simply visit this page to view it live.

= Can any registered user post an auction? =

That's entirely up to you. All registered users with subscriber role or better will be able to place bids and make payments, but you control who can post auctions. 

You can host auctions from a privileged few or allow your entire community to trade items. Set permissions under the `Prospress | General Settings` admin menu.

= Where can I get support? =

In the Prospress [support forums](http://prospress.org/forums/ "Prospress Forums").

= Where can I find documentation? =

Introductory articles are available in the [Prospress Codex](http://codex.prospress.org// "Prospress Documentation").

If have a knack for learning new software, and could improve this sentence, you can help add to the documentation. [Contact us](http://prospress.org/contact/ "Prospress Contact Page") to get an author account for the Prospress Codex.

= Where can I report a bug? =

Please report bugs in the Prospress [Bug Report](http://prospress.org/forums/forum/bug-reports "Prospress Bug Report Forum") forum.

= Where can I get access to the development version? =

Prospress is hosted in a Git repository at [GitHub](http://github.com/Prospress/Prospress "Prospress GitHub Project"). GitHub is also the primary development site for the project.

If your dreams contain curly braces, you can contribute to the Prospress code base on [GitHub](http://github.com/Prospress/Prospress "Prospress GitHub Project"). GitHub makes it easy to contribute and they provide great [documentation](http://help.github.com/) and [getting started guides](http://help.github.com/) to get you up and running.

= Is that it? =

Nope. There are a few surprises but you'll have to download & explore Prospress to find them, or try the [Demo Marketplace](http://demo.prospress.org/auctions/).

== Screenshots ==

1. **Add an Auction** - Publishing an auction is just like publishing a post, except you also add a start price and end date.
2. **Give Feedback** - When an auction completes, the two parties can provide feedback for each other.
3. **Set Capabilities** - All registered users can make bids & payments, but administrators choose who can publish & edit auctions.
